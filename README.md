======TASK-1: Making a Calculator w/o use of Math Library======

The Calculator is an interactive program to calculate linear algebra(+,-,/,*), basic trigonometric ratios and exponents.

---The Linear Algebra Program---
1. The Linear Algebra program DOES NOT follow BODMAS rule.
2. The Linear Algebra program takes input in the form (expression = ), eg, -3+4/6-2=.
3. The Linear Algebra program gives answer with a precision of 20 decimal places, if required.

---Basic Trigonometric Ratios Program---
1. The Program can take input of angle in the unit Radian and Degrees.
2. The Program can calculate the sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec and cot of the angle with a precision of 10 digits, but accuracy depends on the angle input.

---Exponentials---
1. The Program takes two inputs, a(double), b(integer).
2. The Program Outputs a^b or a raised to b.

======TASK-2: Making a Bank ======

v0:
1. The IITI Bank allows users to create an account by adding their names, IITI Roll number, and password.
2. The initial balance after signing up for a user is set to 0.
3. For running the bank server in your computer,you MUST first run the file task2_initiate.cpp. This creates 4 text files in the local directory where the data of users will be stored, and not deleted after closing or rerunning the program.
4. The bank takes input of money in INTEGRAL values in Rupees ONLY.
5. A user can Send money to another account if it exists in the data stored in text files.
6. A user can credit or debit amount from ther account, and also see their name and balance.
7. A user can also change their credentials like Password and Name.
8. A user can't change their Account Number, i.e. IITI Roll number preferably.
