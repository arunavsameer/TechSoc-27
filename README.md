======TASK-1: Making a Calculator w/o use of Math Library======

The Calculator is an interactive program to calculate linear algebra(+,-,/,*), basic trigonometric ratios and exponents.

---The Linear Algebra Program---
1. The Linear Algebra program DOES NOT follow BODMAS rule.
2. The Linear Algebra program takes input in the form (expression = ), eg, -3+4/6-2=.
3. The Linear Algebra program gives answer with a precision of 20 decimal places, if required.

---Basic Trigonometric Ratios Program---
1. The Program can take input of angle in the unit Radian and Degrees.
2. The Program can calculate the sin, cos, tan, cosec, sec and cot of the angle with a precision of 10 digits, but accuracy depends on the angle input.

---Exponentials---
1. The Program takes two inputs, a(double), b(integer).
2. The Program Outputs a^b or a raised to b.
